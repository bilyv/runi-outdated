# Frontend Architecture

## Overview
The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool. The UI is styled with Tailwind CSS and follows a component-based architecture.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with Hooks
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API and Convex React SDK
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **UI Components**: Custom component library with Lucide React icons
- **Notifications**: Sonner

## Component Architecture

### Layout Components
- `Navbar`: Top navigation bar with profile dropdown
- `Sidebar`: Side navigation menu
- `BusinessDashboard`: Main dashboard layout component

### Feature Components
Each feature has its own directory with related components:
- **Auth**: Sign in, sign up, forgot password forms
- **Dashboard**: Main dashboard view with statistics
- **Products**: Product listing, creation, and management
- **Sales**: Sales recording and management
- **Expenses**: Expense tracking and categorization
- **Documents**: File and folder management
- **Transactions**: Financial transaction overview
- **Reports**: Business reporting and analytics
- **Settings**: User profile and preferences
- **Users**: Team member management

### UI Components
Reusable UI components in `src/components/ui/`:
- `Button`: Customizable button component
- `Input`: Styled input field
- `Modal`: Modal dialog component
- `Portal`: React portal for rendering overlays
- `StatCard`: Statistics card for dashboard

## State Management

### React Context
- `ThemeProvider`: Manages dark/light theme state
- Custom contexts for feature-specific state when needed

### Convex Integration
- `useQuery`: For fetching real-time data
- `useMutation`: For modifying data
- `useAction`: For complex operations
- Automatic subscription and re-rendering when data changes

## Routing
Implemented with React Router v6:
- `/` - Dashboard (default route)
- `/:module` - Specific module views (products, sales, etc.)
- Authentication routes handled by Convex components

Navigation between modules is handled by the `BusinessDashboard` component which manages the active module state and renders the appropriate feature component.

## Styling

### Tailwind CSS
- Utility-first CSS framework
- Custom color palette for light/dark themes
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Consistent spacing and typography

### Theme System
- Light and dark themes
- Theme preference persisted in localStorage
- Toggle button in Navbar
- Context-based theme switching

## Key Features

### Real-time Updates
- Data automatically updates when backend changes
- No manual refresh required
- Smooth user experience with live data

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Adaptive layouts for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly controls
- Collapsible sidebar for mobile

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliant with WCAG

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting by route
- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo
- Bundle optimization with Vite

## Build and Deployment

### Development
- Hot module replacement with Vite
- TypeScript compilation
- Tailwind CSS JIT compilation

### Production
- Minified bundle generation
- Static asset optimization
- Environment variable injection

## Testing
- Component testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- End-to-end testing with Cypress
- Visual regression testing

## Future Enhancements
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support
- Advanced caching strategies
- Offline functionality
- Internationalization (i18n)
